    <p>Greetings! Thank you for visiting this page. As you already know, my name is Kate Kelly. This whole coding thing is all very new to me but with each passing day I am learning so many new and interesting things that any fears I had in the beginning of this course have been put to the wayside. In my career I have worked in mainly hospitality and feel this path has taught me how to be patient, a good listener, and most importantly how to collaborate with all types of people. </p>
