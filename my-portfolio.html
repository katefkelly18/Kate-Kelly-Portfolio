            <p>Greetings! Thank you for visiting this page. As you already know, my name is Kate Kelly. This whole coding thing is all very new to me but with each passing day I am learning so many new and interesting things that any fears I had in the beginning of this course have gone away. In my career I have worked in mainly hospitality and feel this path has taught me how to be patient, a good listener, and most importantly how to collaborate with all types of people. </p>
            <p>There are a few things I love most in this world, the first being my family. In the picture below you will see my immediate family to the right and my husband's family to the left. This picture was taken last year at our wedding in Dublin, Ireland, which is where my husband is from.</p>
